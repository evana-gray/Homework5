Instead of each dot being a distinct color - males and females have their own scatterplot side by side. The male scores appear slightly more widely dispersed than the female scores.\n\n```{r}\ngs2 <- ggplot(combined, aes(x = G1.x, y = G3.x))\ngs2 + geom_point() + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) + labs(x = \"Math G1 Score\", y = \"Math G3 Score\") + facet_wrap(~sex) + theme_light()\n```\n\n## Scatterplot with multi categorical facet\n\nMore than one categorical value can be used to research the G1 to G3 relationship. The 2x2 plot below shows this relationship by sex and by school. The same positive linear relationship is seen across all quadrants though the GP school has many more data points.\n\n```{r}\ngs3 <- ggplot(combined, aes(x = G1.x, y = G3.x))\ngs3 + geom_point() + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) + labs(x = \"Math G1 Score\", y = \"Math G3 Score\") + \n      facet_grid(rows = vars(school), cols = vars(sex))\n```\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"homework5.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
